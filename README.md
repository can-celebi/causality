## Session Materials

**Currently available**: Session 1

### Session 1 Templates

Session 1 materials are located in `R/session1/`. We provide multiple templates covering the same R fundamentals concepts with different datasets:

- **Titanic theme** (`R/session1/titanic/`): Classic Titanic passenger dataset
- **Mixed datasets** (`R/session1/mix/`): Spotify, Adult, Star Wars, and other real-world datasets
- **Base template** (`R/session1/`): Student data examples

Each template comes with:
1. A **template R file** for you to complete during the session
2. An **answer key R file** with solutions to check your work
3. A **cheatsheet** with common functions and patterns (where available)

### Previous Versions

Earlier versions of Session 1 templates are archived in `R/session1/archive/` for reference.

More sessions will be added throughout the semester as we progress through the course.

## How Sessions Work

1. During the session, we'll work through **one template** together
2. We'll answer as much as we can in the time available
3. For remaining questions, you work through them on your own
4. Use the answer key R file to check your work and learn alternative approaches

## Note on Solutions

The provided answers are examples—not the only way to solve these problems. R is flexible, and there are many valid approaches to reach the same answer. Feel free to experiment and develop your own solutions!
