# Causality Course Materials

This repository contains R templates and exercises for the causality course.

## Getting Started

You can access these materials in two ways:
- **Download**: Download the repository directly from the course website
- **Clone**: If you're familiar with Git, clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

## Session Materials

**Currently available**: Session 1

We have three templates for Session 1, covering the same concepts with different datasets:
- **Titanic theme**: Classic Titanic dataset
- **Various datasets**: Multiple different datasets
- **No dataset theme**: Made-up student coffee drinking data

Each template comes with:
1. A template R file for you to complete during the session
2. An answer key R file with solutions

More sessions will be added throughout the semester as we progress through the course.

## How Sessions Work

1. During the session, we'll work through **one template** together
2. We'll answer as much as we can in the time available
3. For remaining questions, you work through them on your own
4. Use the answer key R file to check your work and learn alternative approaches

## Note on Solutions

The provided answers are examples—not the only way to solve these problems. R is flexible, and there are many valid approaches to reach the same answer. Feel free to experiment and develop your own solutions!
